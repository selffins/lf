* What is this?

A box of notes about the words "Independent Study".

* Principles

** On Notes and the Course Website

A lot of the work (the share will be lesser once a good system is established) are about the webpage and course.

That's intentional -- it's part of the course goals, to "Build strong habits and a decent familiarity for further in-depth study or research in formal methods."

Well, part of strong habits is a good workflow - it'll serve as a way to organize my own knowledge base in the future! It's also just plainly therapeutic :) and serves as a hobby. I really really /really/ love emacs.

And making the notes pretty and comprehensive is literally 60% of the grade. There is another related goal: "Learn to effectively communicate formal methods concepts."

** On metacognition, reflection

One of the ways "Comprehension" gets evaluated is by

(reflecting) "metacognitively about course progress and learning strategies and broader connections for each week".
#+END_QUOTE

This involves:

- Documenting the learning process. In rhetoric, we are taught that crafting arguments (e.g. essays) is a form of thinking. The process of writing is much more important than the actual product. Since we *already* have a book, it wouldn't make sense for the notes to *copy* the book. It's more of a *study journal* than it is notes.
- Asking questions. I note down questions immediately-- as soon as I think of them in the notes.
- Documenting the working-out of the exercises.
- Relating the lesson with further concepts. This involves looking things up in the internet, in wikis, in academic resources, papers. I like to read a lot of type theory / formal methods / history of mathematics stuff and it will be a great way to consolidate concepts. This involves looking up concrete examples and industry applications.
- Original writing. I plan to make original content - essays - about the interesting history surrounding theorem provers. I already have a post about Barendregt. Another idea is studying the origins of the ITP tactics - Frege, Euclid, Aristotle, Leibniz comes to mind. =reflexivity= is obviously a
- Deep reading. Girard, Frege, Russell, Coquand, Per Martin Lof, Pierce all have so much interesting stuff to say about the theoretical stuff - mathematical logic.
- An avoidance of AI tools. I love chatbots. I use them *a LOT*. But what I will never use it for is to do the hard work for me. Or even do the researching around for me. It's so fun to learn - AI robs you of that process. Independent study means independent study.,

** Health and Wellbeing

The student is required to prioritize their wellbeing and seek assistance if problems are encountered. In fact, working on this independent study actually improves the student's wellbeing! :)


* TODO Notes structure

- Further reading
- Next

* Todo-list
*** DONE open github repo
*** TODO display commit message in the top of the webpage, or latest edit!
*** TODO link advisor and student's websites.
*** TODO github actions, org-publish
*** TODO create discord group, with discord-github notifications
*** DONE fix spacing issues
*** TODO typography. embed iosevka font
*** TODO maybe revamp the way I do headlines
*** TODO Headlines should be collapsible
*** TODO links to attached LOCAL sf book
*** TODO add tags to sections
*** TODO make priority tags visible!
**** TODO revamp how we display exercises. Maybe we should have a summary table showing the number of stars, completion, name, etc.
*** TODO research org-roam and integrate it for a knowledge base type of organization.
*** TODO org-agenda integration. There should be a TODOs page where all the todo lists across the pages appear.
*** TODO make template pages for notes. A new note page should follow the note-structure in 1.14.1.; it should have a previous notes and next notes link, homepage link, back to top link. Files should link to the chapter Coq file.
*** TODO add homework submission platform. My own Gradescope????

* Article/Broader reading ideas

*** TODO History of proof theory

*** TODO Practical tips

*** TODO Coq applications

*** TODO Interesting developments with AI + ITPs

*** TODO Origins of tactics

Euclid in particular comes to mind.

*** TODO On Brouwer's Automath vision

I've already written this! I just need to publish it now.

*** TODO Comparison of ITPs

I am very interested in particular with Lean and Agda.

*** TODO Girard and Coquand and Martin-Lof

*** TODO HoTT

*** TODO The Logic Front of the Empiricist-Rationalist war
