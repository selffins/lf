* Summary

The chapter introduces Coq's native functional language called Gallina. We also go through proof by simplication, rewriting, and case analysis, and the tactics needed for such proofs. We define natural numbers, booleans; some simple functions on natural numbers and booleans; and prove properties about the functions. We explore Coq's type system.

* Some basic syntax

Functional programming has code that have no side effects. There is a better connection from programs to mathematical objects.

Functions are first-class values. They can be passed as arguments to other functions.

Other features include algebraic data types (sum, product types), pattern matching, polymorphic type systems.

Coq's native functional language is called *Gallina*.

Coq's built-in features are small. Because we can build almost all the definitions we need. What follows is some small snippets of interest. Refer to the book for more complete snippets.

Defining a type.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Inductive NAME : Type :=
| ...
.
#+END_SRC

In this chapter, they first work with enumerated types. We will see tuple types, parametrized types, and so on as well.

Defining a function.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Definition name arg1 arg2 ... :=
...
.
#+END_SRC

Match.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
match X with
| PATTERN -> RESULT
...
end.

#+END_SRC

There is a command "Compute" that evaluates expressions.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Compute EXP.
#+END_SRC

Examples, or "unit tests". And our first proof, and usage of tactics.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Example test_orb1 (orb true false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
#+END_SRC

We are trying to prove an *example* that  applying orb (logical or) to true and false gives us true. We start a *proof* and use the tactics *simplification* and *reflexivity* to prove it. And then we end, so *Qed*. There will be discussion of proofs shortly.

Infix notation.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Notation "x && y" := (andb x y) = true.
#+END_SRC
Booleans. Conditionals are like in SML:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
if p then x else y
#+END_SRC

An interesting thing is that the guard in the conditional will work with any two-valued type. As in, two-valued types are treated the same as booleans in the sense that the first constructor is treated as True and the other constructor as False. This is useful if we want to make datatypes like "blackOrWhite" which is either "black" or "white".

We can create *Modules*, we can use them for namespaces.

Types are defined with the keyword Inductive.

Types can be parametrized - a type constructor can take another element of some type.

A type with a single type constructor with multiple parameters can be used to define a tuple type. E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Inductive nybble : Type :=
| bits (b0 b1 b2 b3 : bit).
#+END_SRC

So far, the chapter has shown enumerated types, parametrized types, and tuple types. Enumerated types have a finite set of elements. If we want to create an type with an infinite set, like the natural numbers, the type constructor must take itself as a parameter - an inductive definition.

The chapter differentiates type constructors and functions - both of them "take" something as input - however, functions are defined by computation rules, but type constructors are simply representations.

Functions are defined with the "Definition" keyword. However, to declare a recursive function, we must use the Fixpoint keyword.

The chapter points out that the simpl tactic has no effect on the proof goals (of the example proofs), only reflexivity does the work. TBD shortly.

There is a notational convenience: if two arguments have the same type, they can be written together. E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Fixpoint mult (n m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => O
  | S n' => plus m (mult n' m)
  end.
#+END_SRC

Coq does really come with not a lot built in. Natural number comparisons are built in by the user, for example.

Propositions are logical claims. So, 1 =? 0 is an expression that evaluates to a boolean, but 1 = 0 is a logical claim that you can (try) to prove.

Note that Coq code lines ends with periods.

* Proof by simplification

So far, all of the proofs were the same: use =simpl= to simplify both sides, and then use =reflexivity= to check that both contain identical values.

We can use this "proof by simplification" to establish more interesting properties. =0= is a neutral element (or identity element) because =0 + n= reduces to =n= no matter what =n= is.

We have our first theorem:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Theorem plus_O_n : forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
#+END_SRC

We also used an universal quantifier.

The chapter notes that the =reflexivity= tactic is powerful - in the proofs so far, the =simpl= tactic were actually not required, because =reflexivity= does some simplification by itself. And, =reflexivity= actually does /more/ simplification than =simpl= does! It tries unfolding defined terms, replacing them with their right hand sides. =simpl= is used when we want an intermediate state, where we need to read and understand the new goal it creates, so that it isn't expanding definitions eagerly like with =reflexivity= and leave the goal "messy".

The keywords =Example=, =Theorem=, =Fact=, =Lemma=, =Remark= mean "pretty much the same thing" in Coq. It is a matter of style.

Here's the proof for our theorem.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Theorem plus_O_n : forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
Proof.
  intros n. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
#+END_SRC

=intros n= is basically like saying "Suppose n is a natural number" in a proof - it fixes some n and progresses the proof by dealing with the universal quantifier. =intros n= moves the quantifier in the goal to a /context/ of current assumptions.

A tactic is a command that guides the process of checking some claim. It's a move in the proof.

* Proof by rewriting

We have a new kind of theorem - one that uses an implication - it's not a universal property of nunbers, it's a specific one that holds if =n=m=.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Theorem plus_id_example : forall n m:nat,
  n = m ->
  n + n = m + m.
#+END_SRC

To prove this, we need to assume the hypotheses - we can use the =intro= tactic to get all the needed variables into context.

Because =n= and =m= are /arbitrary/ numbers, we can't use simplification, which works on expressions (?). We prove this instead by noticing that if we replace =n= with =m= in the right hand side, and =n = m=, then it holds. This is called *proof by rewriting*. We use the tactic =rewrite=.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Proof.
  (* move both quantifiers into the context: *)
  intros n m.
  (* move the hypothesis into the context: *)
  intros H.
  (* rewrite the goal using the hypothesis: *)
  rewrite -> H.
  reflexivity.  Qed.
#+END_SRC

Note that we move the quantified variables into the context, but we also move the *hypothesis* into the context - we assume it, then continue with the goal. The =rewrite= tactic uses the hypothesis.  =rewrite ->= means rewriting right to left, which is the default. =rewrite <-= means rewriting left to right.

We can use the =rewrite= tactic with a theorem instead of a hypothesis from a context. If the theorem has quantified variables, Coq will try to fill in the appropriate values by matching the theorem with the current goal.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Theorem mult_n_0_m_0 : forall p q : nat,
  (p * 0) + (q * 0) = 0.
Proof.
  intros p q.
  rewrite <- mult_n_O.
  rewrite <- mult_n_O.
  reflexivity. Qed.
#+END_SRC
* Proof by case analysis
Not everything can be proved with simplification and rewriting. Unknown values (those quantified over) can block simplification.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Theorem plus_1_neq_0_firsttry : forall n : nat,
  (n + 1) =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n.
  simpl.  (* does nothing! *)
Abort.
#+END_SRC

=(n + 1)= is a term that can't be simplified, because =n= is general. So, =simpl= does nothing.

Instead we have to use case analysis - =n= is either zero, or a successor of some =m=.

If =n= is zero, then =0 + 1= is clearly not equal to =0=. If =n= is =S m=, it is enough that it is a successor to say that it is not zero.

A case analysis is done in Coq using the =destruct= tactic. It's called destruct because it considers each case where a value uses a certain constructor - and gives you sub-goals for them.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Theorem plus_1_neq_0 : forall n : nat,
  (n + 1) =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.   Qed.
#+END_SRC

There is an annotation "=as [| n']=" - this tells Coq what variable names to use in each sub-goal. Zero does not have a parameter, so it is empty. The annotation =eqn:E= tells destruct to give a name to the current case, i.e, either =n = 0=
or =n = S n'=. It's optional - you can leave this annotation off and Coq will assign variable names automatically, but that is bad style as the auto-assigned names are usually confusing.

There are =-= signs: they are called bullets, they mark the proofs for the generated subgoals and ensure that a subgoal is complete before trying the next one. It's good practice to mark cases with bullets. Bullets are optional, if omitted, Coq asssumes you do the subgoals in order.

You can use different kinds of bullets for subproofs: =+=, =*=, and any repetition (e.g. =---= or =***=). Sub-proofs can be enclosed in curly braces.

The =destruct= tactic can be used with any inductively defined datatype.

I learned a new word: involutive - when an operation is its own inverse.

We may notice that many proofs perform case analysis on a variable right after introducing it, as such:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
intros x y. destruct y as [|y] eqn:E.
#+END_SRC

Here is the shorthand in action. We can simply use the intro pattern after =intros= instead of using the =destruct= tactic and then using a intro pattern.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Theorem plus_1_neq_0' : forall n : nat,
  (n + 1) =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros [|n].
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.  Qed.
#+END_SRC

The downside is that we lose the equation recording the assumption in each subgoal, which we got from the =eqn:E= annotation.

* Optional: More on Notation

There are some chapters labeled "Optional". The authors recommend skimming them.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Notation "x + y" := (plus x y)
                       (at level 50, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
Notation "x * y" := (mult x y)
                       (at level 40, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
#+END_SRC

For a notation symbol, we can specify the *precedence level* and *associativity*. Coq uses precedence levels from 0 to 100, and left, right, or no associativity.

Apparently, a notation symbol also has a *notation scope* (what?).

* Optional: Fixpoints and Structural Recursion

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Fixpoint plus' (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => m
  | S n' => S (plus' n' m)
  end.
#+END_SRC

Here, Coq notes that the function is decreasing in the first argument. We are performing a structural recursion over the argument =n= - making sure that we only make recursive calls on strictly smaller values of =n=. This is a proof of termination. Coq *demands* that some argument of every =Fixpoint= is decreasing.

This is a part of Coq's design - it guarantees that every function will terminate. However, apparently, Coq's automatic analysis of whether inputs decrease isn't very sophisticated, and apparently it is sometimes necessary to write functions in slightly unnatural ways. (What?)

* Exercises
There are 20 exercises in total. The following are the exercises in the main text.

** [#C] nandb
Shows how to use =simpl= and =reflexivity=.
** [#C] andb3
Same as above.
** [#C] factorial
Shows how to define a fixpoint function.
** [#C] ltb
** [#C] plus​_id​_exercise
Introducing the =intros= tactic, for variables and hypotheses.
** [#C] mult​_n​_1
Shows to use/invoke theorems in proofs using =rewrite=.
** [#B] andb​_true​_elim2
Shows how to use =destruct= for case analysis. This was a bit tricky before I realized how to step one tactic at a time. You destruct two times. When encountering a contradiction, use it to =rewrite=.
** [#B] decreasing (optional)
The problem was to write a recursive function that terminates on all inputs but gets rejected by Coq's unsophisticated automatic analysis of decreasing arguments.

Answer:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Fixpoint summation (i : nat) (n : nat) : nat :=
  if i =? n
  then n
  else i + (summation (i+1) n).
#+END_SRC

Wow, it's actually interesting how Coq is unable to analyze this simple function as decreasing! They should borrow Why3's =variant= keyword - =n - i= is strictly decreasing. In Why3, you'd have to include this =variant= keyword or else Why3 would complain about the function not being proved as terminating.

** [#C] zero​_nbeq​_plus​_1

Straightforward.

* Exercises (Warmups)

These were pretty straightforward uses of rewrites and/or case analysis.

** [#C] identity​_fn​_applied​_twice
** [#C] negation​_fn​_applied​_twice
** [#A] andb​_eq​_orb

* Testing Your Solutions

The test file for this chapter is =BasicsTest.v=. To run it, make sure you have saved =Basics.v= to disk. Then first run =coqc -Q . LF Basics.v= and then run =coqc -Q . LF BasicsTest.v=; or, if you have make installed, you can run =make BasicsTest.vo=. (Make sure you do this in a directory that also contains a file named =_CoqProject= containing the single line =-Q . LF.=)

The output is useful:
1. The actual output from the Coq file itself.
2. For each exercise, its point value, whether the type is ok, what assumptions it relies on.
3. Maximum number of points in standard and advanced versions of the assignment.
4. A list of allowed axioms.
5. A summary of whether you have solved each exercise.

Manually graded exercises show up but the test script doesn't give a lot of information.
* Questions

** Not a (co-)inductive type? (Propositions are not booleans)

When doing the factorial exercise, I defined factorial as such:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
Fixpoint factorial (n:nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | S n => if (n > 0) then n * factorial(n-1) else 1
  end.
#+END_SRC

I needed the conditional so that it terminates for negative inputs. Well, I didn't need to do this, because 1) n is a natural number, not an integer 2) n > 0 always because 0 is already matched.

Anyway, with this conditional, I get the error:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Error: The term "n0 > 0" has type "Prop" which is not a (co-)inductive type.
#+END_SRC

Why is this happening? I am assuming that =Prop= is the proposition type, are propositions different from booleans? Why is the comparison typed as a =Prop= instead of a boolean?

_Answer_

Yes, I read later in the chapter that propositions are different from booleans. For example, =1 = 0= is a *logical claim*, a proposition you can *prove*, but =1 =? 0= (=?= is boolean equality) is an expression that evaluates to a boolean. So, =n0 > 0= is type =Prop= - we need to use a less than operator that is in the boolean world.

** TODO There's a difference? (Tuple pattern vs multiple patterns in case analysis)

Apparently, there is a difference between the patterns =a, b= and =(a, b)=!

These don't work:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
match leb n m, eqb n m with
  | true, false => true
  | _ => false
end.
#+END_SRC

The compiler will complain that it expects two patterns for the second case.

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
match (leb n m, eqb n m) with
  | true, false => true
  | _ => false
end.
#+END_SRC

Here, the compiler will complain that it expects one pattern for the first case.

However, these work:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
match leb n m, eqb n m with
  | true, false => true
  | _, _ => false
end.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
match (leb n m, eqb n m) with
  | (true, false) => true
  | _ => false
end.
#+END_SRC

Why is there a difference, or what is the difference?

** TODO What's the difference between =rewrite ->= and =rewrite <-=?

Apparently =rewrite ->= is rewriting from "left to right" while =rewrite <-= is rewriting from "right to left".

What is the difference? When does it matter and what's an example of when it matters?

** TODO How do I use the Coq IDE?

I want to see what the current goal looks like, at an intermediate proof step. I don't know how to do that.

SOLVED: It's pretty simple. Use the arrows to step through each line. The screen on the right shows you the current goal.

** TODO Decreasing arguments

Coq demands that at least one argument in a =Fixpoint= definition of a function be strictly decreasing. This ensures that all functions terminate. How does Coq do this? And why does the author say that Coq's way of doing this is unsophisticated, and that it is "sometimes necessary to write functions in slightly unnatural ways?"

** TODO What is a notation scope?

A notation (infix operator) has precedence, associativity, and a notation scope. What's a notation scope? This isn't too important (it's just for infix operators in Coq!), but the chapter talks about it but never clarifies or defines what a notation scope is.

* Metacognition

I think that the book so far is really fun. I also like the way I am making notes. I love emacs. There are a lot of exercises.

** Notes structure

I am gonna do this template for notes in the future:

- Summary
- Section 1 (actual notes)
- ...
- Optional sections
- Exercises
- Questions
- Reflections
- Further knowledge

** About Coq
Adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq_(software)

Coq is a *interactive theorem prover* released in 1989. Coq works within the theory of the *calculus of inductive constructions* (what?). Coq is not an automated theorem prover.

Coq has a specification language (what?) called *Gallina*. Programs in Gallina abide by the *weak normalization* (what?) property, implying that they always terminate. This avoids the *halting problem*.

** Some History

The development of Coq has been supported since 1984 by French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA), initiated by Thierry Coquand and  Gérard Huet.

The Association for Computing Machinery awarded Thierry Coquand, Gérard Huet, Christine Paulin-Mohring, Bruno Barras, Jean-Christophe Filliâtre, Hugo Herbelin, Chetan Murthy, Yves Bertot, and Pierre Castéran with the 2013 ACM Software System Award for Coq.

 *Coq* is rooster in French, and comes from the French tradition of naming research development tools after animals. It is also a reference to Coquand's name and CoC (Calculus of Constructions).
 However, the Coq community has voted to change the name to *"The Rocq Prover"* in coming months.

 *Gallina* means hen in Latin, Spanish, Italian and Catalan.

 Coq was used by Georges Gonthier of Microsoft Research and Benjamin Wenrer of INRIA to create a *surveyable proof* (what?) of the four color theorem in 2002.

 Notable applications include *CompCert*, a optimizing compiler for almost all of the C programming language which is programmed and proven correct in Coq, *Feit-Thompson Theorem* (some substantial group theory thing), and the *Fundamental group* of the circle.

 In 2024, Coq proved the value of the 5-state Busy beaver. The value of the 5-state winning busy beaver was discovered by Heiner Marxen and Jürgen Buntrock back in 1989.

 *A recent effort within this field is making these tools use artificial intelligence to automate the formalization of ordinary mathematics.*

** More about CompCert
Adapted from https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5000/current/lectures/cis5000-lec01.pdf, slide 20.

CompCert is by Xavier Leroy at INRIA. The project was started on 2010.

A 2011 PLDI paper studied bugs in C compilers. They generaqted random test cases, put them in source programs, and then compiled it with GCC, LLVM, and 8 other C compilers. There were 325 bugs in total (LLVM: 202, GCC: 79).

CompCert had <10 bugs then (this was when CompCert was still unverified).

After CompCert was verified, they concluded that:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The striking thing about our CompCert results is that the
middle-end bugs we found in all other compilers are
absent. As of early 2011, the under-development version of
CompCert is the only compiler we have tested for which
Csmith cannot find wrong-code errors. This is not for lack
of trying: we have devoted about six CPU-years to the task.
The apparent unbreakability of CompCert supports a
strong argument that developing compiler optimizations
within a proof framework, where safety checks are explicit
and machine-checked, has tangible benefits for compiler
users.
